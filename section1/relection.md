## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?


  The SuperLearner article made me think about what makes 'learning effective' and it made me think about the John Dewey method of 'learn by doing' with the additional 'learn by teaching' mindset. I love to read so this made me feel like I'm not putting off work by taking reading breaks. I wish I was teaching more of what I'm learning; selfishly to be able to talk through what I think I know.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.


  NUMBERS - Includes negatives, decimals, which are called floating point numbers. 0.25 is an example of a floating point number representing a fraction.

  Strings - Are letters and other characters, wrapped in quotes, either "this" or 'this' kind of quotes.  Numbers and emojis can also be strings as long as they are surrounded by quotation marks.

  Boolean - A true or false, 1 or 0. Any value can only have two outcomes, either true or false. No value can have more than one outcome.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  // code comments can explain my code to other coders, or explain my decisions
  // they can also deactivate portions of code without deleting them


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  A variable is a kind of placeholder, a tool to temporarily store bits of information.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  On Reddit, variables could be search terms, individual r/'s, or the text in a comment.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  Concatenation is the 'bringing together' of different variables; in JavaScript it is represented by the plus sign. The variables can be strings of text, emojis, numbers or words all wrapped within the back tick.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

  On Reddit, concatenation is probably used for determining user 'flair' and displaying various comments.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  I don't understand what markdown is! What is it and why use it? What is the difference between Interpolation and Concatenation in practical terms?
