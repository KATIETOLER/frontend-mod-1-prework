// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
var team = "The Holyhead Harpies";

console.log(`${name}'s favorite Quidditch team is ${team}`);


// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;

console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var dobbySays = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!';

console.log(`${dobbySays}`)

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Nagini";
var isHungry = "Yes";
var numberOfPets = "200";

console.log(`Is ${firstName} hungry? ${isHungry}. Oh no! We have ${numberOfPets} ${firstName}'s to feed!`)

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.


//  First I thought of  a sentence that I believed would make sense.
//  Then I assigned the variable types based on what I wanted to say.

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = "Bethany the Lion";
var isHungry = "No... well, maybe a little.";
var numberOfPets = "53042";

console.log(`Is ${firstName} hungry? ${isHungry}.
  God help us all! We have ${numberOfPets} ${firstName}'s to feed!`)


// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;

console.log(`I have ${healthySnacks} carrots and ${junkFoodSnacks} bags of chips!`)
//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
