## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
---
  Villanueva's article suggests the S.M.A.R.T. goal system. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals was an idea that resonated with me. I liked this system because it is hard to set reasonable goals. As a person, I tend to want to achieve longer-termed goals even if breaking down those goals would make things easier and keep me on task. The idea of short-term goals is a really interesting idea that I don't feel I have often followed in my life.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
---
  I feel pretty okay with making mistakes for the most part. I feel making mistakes is critical to learning. At the same time, I am often harsher on myself than others when mistakes are made.

---
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
---
On instagram the 'followers' list might be an array. It is an ordered list of all the people the account follows. A developer might want to access certain data at certain indexes in the followers list.
---

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
---
  An Array Methods allow us to perform certain actions within an array. Methods are like functions that operate specifically on the array to which they are tied. Some examples are: removing the first item in the array index, removing the list item in an array index, and accessing a specific position in the array index.
---
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
---
  Loops help us check a condition. If a developer wanted to perform an action (or series of actions!) on each item in an array they would use a loop. If a certain action is needed to be performed on an ordered list, then use a loop in conjunction with an array. If an action is needed to be performed without an ordered list, then you do not use both an array and a loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
---
  It's kind of like having a large group of stuffed animals to whom you want to say good night. First, you would check to see if you like that stuffed animal, if you do, then you say good night. If not, you do not say good night. You do this for all of the stuffed animals in a certain group. At the end, you might check again to see if you missed anybody!
---
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
---
  No questions, but I need more practice!
