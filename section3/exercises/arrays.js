// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.splice(2);

animals.push("Gorilla");

console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.splice(2);
animals.push("Tarsier");

console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

var foodKinds = ["String Cheese","Cheddar Cheese","Swiss Cheese","Gouda Cheese"]
console.log(foodKinds);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(foodKinds.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

foodKinds.push("broccoli ): ")

console.log(foodKinds);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed

foodKinds.pop();
console.log(foodKinds);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

foodKinds.push("Brie","Sharp Cheddar","Muenster Cheese")
console.log(foodKinds);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foodKinds.shift();
console.log(foodKinds);

// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: *Subreddits on Reddit*
// 2: *Playlists on Spotify* are lists of songs
// 3: *Currently watching on Netflix* is a list of what I have recently been interacting with

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.
*/

// Write your conditional here

var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "outlet";

// Declare the variable yesCharger which is
// assigned to the value of the both chargerType strictly equals "car" AND (conditional operator &&) hasCharger strictly equals true
var yesCharger = ((chargerType === "car") && (hasCharger === true));
// Declare yesBattery as percentBatteryLeft greater than 14
var yesBattery = (percentBatteryLeft >14);

//Check to see if yesCharger and yesBattery are able to communicate with the variables they are tied to
console.log(yesCharger);
console.log(yesBattery);

// Conditional one, if yesBattery is strictly true, then log the happy message
if (yesBattery === true) {
console.log("You can call an Uber!");
}
//Conditional two, if the above returns false, check to see if yesCharger is strictly true, if yes then log the happy message
else if (yesCharger === true) {
console.log("You can call an Uber!");
}
//final conditional, if none of the above logs true, then log the sad message
else {
  console.log("Get walkin'!");
}



// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
