## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I probably tend to wait too long to ask questions. I would rather figure it out on my own because I am afraid of being a bother or being embarrassed by the answer. Many times it is possible to google the answer or to comb through other answers to similar questions to piece together an answer; or at least to find the right question. But I should be more aware of my own frustration levels; at a certain point, as Grayson Nanz writes in her article "Your Questions Are Dumb; Ask Them Anyway." She writes about how the "hours of fiddling and banging your head against the wall" are really a waste of her valuable time more than anything else.



1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  Initially it was frustrating, but I  really did get better at using terminal. It also helped me figure out a few websites I like using to look things up as well as sites I found particularly unhelpful because they were writing to someone with a lot more knowledge than me.



1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  A conditional statement is based on the concept of if/then/else. A conditional is based on, of course, certain conditions. There are two parts of the evaluation of a conditional. First an expression is evaluated and a value is returned. Then a conditional statement says what the code should do in a given situation.


   An everyday example is: If I see my dog's water bowl is empty, then I will fill it. If it is full, I will do nothing. In a web application context: If I press play on Spotify, it will then play that song. If I do not press play, nothing will happen.


  If a the first, 'if' condition is met, then the code will execute one or more statements. If the first condition is not met, the code moves to the next condition, the 'if else' and executes the statements associated with that condition. If this condition is also not met, then the 'else' condition will make the code do something different or skip a step.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  The `if` statement evaluates a given condition or conditions.  If the conditions evaluate to true, then any statements in the subsequent code block will be executed.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  Operators like `&&` and `||` can determine a relationship between two values. By combining two or more comparison operators, you can check if all conditions are met, or just one of a set of conditionals.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?


  Sometimes my code does not evaluate the conditionals based on my arguments and instead just returns the variable string no matter what. I'm sure I am missing something very basic but I don't know what it is. How do functions change the evaluation of conditional statements, if at all?
