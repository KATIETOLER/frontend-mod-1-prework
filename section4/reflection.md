## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
---
The workflow was definitely different. I actually got a **lot** more done in less time which was super weird. I expected
to take longer because of the breaks but do better work. What actually happened was that I did more work and it took less time
somehow.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
---
Setting intentions was really helpful. I was more focused for sure. As I mentioned above I was able to complete my tasks faster
despite taking more breaks than usual; thus my time estimations were pretty off!

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  Objects store data much like an array. However, while an array stores data in an ordered list, an object can use strings to store information more like a mini database that can store and organize information.


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.
---
  * List of all of the students in class
  - An array would be best in my opinion because this would be useful as an ordered list of the students.

  * List of states and their capitals
    - An object, because the states and the capitals are two different but tied together types of data. It would be useful to have the relationship between them defined but for them to operate independently if necessary.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
   - I would make this an array, because it should be an ordered list of items and the items don't need to interact.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - An array, because it is probably useful to have this as an ordered list.

  * List of student names and their cohort
    - An object because the student names should be tied to their cohort.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Also an object because again there are two different types of data that need to do different things and can interact with each other.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  - This should be an array because it should be an ordered list and it does not need to interact with other data.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
---
  - My Amazon cart might be an example of this. It stores my items for purchase and has defined responses if I purchase an item or delete it from the cart. Keys might be: the item name, item price, shipping price, any coupons and so forth.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
---
I don't currently have any questions but I look forward to having more practice with methods inside of objects and just more practice in general. Sometimes I understand the concepts but until I put them into practice a lot I feel unclear in some ways.
